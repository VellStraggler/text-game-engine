## example_code.txt

This will have an example of every kind of code we will be translating. It is the reference for code_translater.py

## inputfilename.txt

This stores one line of text, the name of the code file. The compiler references this to know what file to load, and stores it here on the first load.

## textart.py

This was a reference for use on the mapeditor, but that no longer has priority.

## mapeditor

No longer has priority

## code_translator.py

This reads code files, map files, and sprite files, and translates the code and compiles all of it into a working game.
